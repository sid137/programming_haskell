3. Deﬁne a function product that produces the product of a list of numbers,
and show using your deﬁnition that product [2, 3, 4] = 24.



product [x] = 
	product [] = 1
	product (x:xs) = x * product xs


test: product [2,3,4] = 24

product [2,3,4] =

	2 * prouct[3,4] 
	2 * 3 * product[4]
	2 * 3 * 4 * product []
	2 * 3 * 4 * 1
	6 * 4 * 1
	24 * 1
	24
