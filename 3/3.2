2. What are the types of the following functions?

	second xs = head (tail xs)
	swap (x , y) = (y, x )
	pair x y = (x , y)
	double x = x ∗2
	palindrome xs = reverse xs == xs
	twice f x = f (f x )

Hint: take care to include the necessary class constraints if the functions are
deﬁned using overloaded operators.

[a] -> a
(a, b) -> (b, a)
a -> b -> (a,b)
Num a => a -> a  
[a] -> Bool  //  Eq a => [a] -> Bool
a -> ( a -> a )
